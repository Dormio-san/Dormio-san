- 👋 Hiya, I’m @Dormio-san (Liam Lovett)
- 👀 I’m interested in cars, geography, games, and anything that makes my brain work!
- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Digital Media. I'm also learning about game development in Unity, Unreal, and hopefully soon<sup>tm</sup> in Godot.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games, but honestly anything that gets me thinking and learning about new things.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love sleep so much that I based my name off it.

  - BeamNG.drive
  - Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice (all-time favorite)
  - Cities: Skylines
  - Sunset Overdrive
