- 👀 I’m interested in cars, geography, games, and anything that makes my brain work!
- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Digital Media. I'm also learning about game development in Unity, Unreal, and hopefully soon<sup>tm</sup> in Godot.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games, but honestly anything that gets me thinking and learning about new things.
