I started my coding journey back in my sophmore year of highschool. When I was scheduling for classes, I saw a coding class that I thought sounded interesting, so I decided to try it out. During my next couple of years in highschool, I learned how to use GameMaker and Unity. Once I finished highschool, I began attending the University of Central Florida (UCF) to study more about game design. I loved collaborating with other students at UCF to make projects that we were passionate about. My time at UCF added C# and Unreal Blueprints to my skillset. I am excited for the future as I continue to make more games and learn even more about coding!
